**Quiz 2**

**1)** Which best describes high correlation filter dimension reduction?

Answer: "Eliminate dimensions which are co-linear"

**2)** (Linear Model Output): This shows an R linear model for baseball data, with variables Run, Dbl, Trp, HRs, and SOs.

The output shows a high R-squared of 0.8601, adjusted R-squared of 0.8422, and a highly significant F-statistic (p-value: 1.261e-15).

**3)** Which best describes low variance filter dimension reduction?

Answer: "Elimination of dimensions with minimal internal variation."

**4)** The question asks about the ideal shape of the red 'average' line in a Residuals vs. Fitted chart

The answer should be "Horizontal" (as a horizontal line around zero indicates good model fit with no patterns in residuals).

**5)** Based on the 1.5 IQR definition, which statement is true regarding the data set:

50, 34, 45, 34, 43, 96, 36, 42, 33, 39, 51, 31?

Answer: "There is only one outlier." (Likely 96, as it appears to be far from the other values)

**8)** ANOVA test for temperature measurements showing wheel effect is highly significant (p < 2e-16) while sensor effect is not significant (p = 0.847).

**9)** The correlation coefficient that best matches the scatterplot showing a negative relationship between variables would be "-0.96" based on the clear downward trend.

**10)** The equation Σ(X-μ)²/n describes "variance" (the formula shows the sum of squared deviations from the mean divided by n).

**11)** Questions about cross country running times displayed in a box plot: a) How many runners ran faster than 16 minutes? Cannot determine precisely from box plot alone, but likely more than half based on the median below 20 minutes.

b) How many ran slower than 20 minutes? Approximately half, as the median appears to be around 20 minutes.

c) The fastest runner completed the race in approximately 15 minutes (lowest whisker).

d) The interquartile range would be approximately 6 minutes (difference between Q3 and Q1, about 22-16=6).

**12)** Three measures of dispersion discussed in class are:

Answer: "quartile, mode, variance" is selected on the image.

**13)** Covariance measures: Answer: "the degree to which two variables change together."

**14)** What can we conclude from the Wilcoxon signed rank test with p-value = 0.8394? Answer: "The means are probably equal." (Since the high p-value fails to reject the null hypothesis)

**15)** Based on the Normal Q-Q Plot: Answer: "The variable follows an approximately normal distribution." (The points generally follow the diagonal line with minor deviations at the extremes)

**16)** The Spearman's rank correlation output shows:

- rho = 0.0383099
- p-value = 0.04856
- alternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0

This would suggest that there is a weak, positive relationship. (The correlation coefficient is very close to 0 but positive, and the p-value is just under 0.05, indicating statistical significance but a very weak relationship)

**17)** The Shapiro-Wilk normality test output shows:

- W = 0.37192
- p-value = 2.998e-10 (very small)

The variable probably does not have a normal distribution. (The very small p-value means we reject the null hypothesis of normality)

**18)** The F test to compare variances shows:

- F = 1.0837e-17 (extremely small)
- p-value < 2.2e-16 (extremely small)

There is strong evidence to suggest the variances are unequal. (The very small p-value indicates we reject the null hypothesis of equal variances)

**19)** The two-sample t-test output shows:
- t = -3.6455
- p-value = 0.000572
- mean of x: 10.75129, mean of y: 14.52803
- confidence interval: -5.850545 to -1.702950

The true means differ by between 1.70 and 5.85. (The negative t-value and confidence interval entirely below zero indicate y has a significantly higher mean than x)

**20)** The two-sample t-test output shows:
- t = 6.5707
- p-value = 1.536e-08
- mean of x: 14.528035, mean of y: 8.211408
- confidence interval: 4.392325 to 8.240929

The true means differ by between 4.39 and 8.24. (The positive t-value and confidence interval entirely above zero indicate x has a significantly higher mean than y)
