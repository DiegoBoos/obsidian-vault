**Key Steps**

**A.** Null and alternative hypotheses definition
**B.** Test statistic
**C.** P-value and interpretation
**D.** Significance level (optional)

**Statistical Inference**

Statistical inference involves generalizing from a sample to a population with a calculated degree of certainty. This process relies on comparing sample statistics to population parameters.

**Example:** Water Hardness and Mortality

The lecture uses an example of water hardness and mortality data to illustrate the application of various statistical tests. The analysis reveals a significant difference in mortality rates between northern and southern towns, and a correlation between water hardness and mortality.

**T-Test – Types of Comparisons**

Comes in 3 varieties:

- Single sample t – we have only 1 group; want to test against a hypothetical mean.
- Independent samples t – we have 2 means, 2 groups; no relation between groups, e.g., people randomly assigned to a single group.
- Dependent t – we have two means. Either same people in both groups, or people are related, e.g., husband-wife, left hand-right hand, hospital patient and visitor. That is, the data is paired.

**A note on Hypothesis Testing**

Some people are often confused/frustrated by the wording of hypothesis testing statements. For example, if a test reveals a p-value above our specified level of significance (by custom, 0.05) we generally say we can not reject the null hypothesis. Note carefully that the test itself does not permit us to say that we accept a hypothesis with certainty. In practice of course, we often treat it that way but it is not technically accurate.

A practical example may prove useful here. Suppose we see a person dressed in very dirty, torn clothes. We may hypothesize: Ho: “This person is poor.” Suppose as well that we observe that the person walks to save on bus money, or skips lunch to save money. Neither of these provide evidence that allows us to reject our initial hypothesis. We could gather many other such observations, which may lead us to conclude the hypothesis is true, but, we can not accept the hypothesis until we know everything about the person.

However, it takes only one observation to allow us to reject the hypothesis. For example, if we discovered the person had no debts and a bank account with $2,000,000 we could now reject our hypothesis that “This person is poor.”

Hopefully this brief example helps you better understand the limitations or hypothesis tests.

**Notes on Correlation**

Pearson offers a more complete description of the association between two variables if they are both normally distributed

Spearman ranks and is therefore useful for ordinal data, non-normal data is robust to outliers
