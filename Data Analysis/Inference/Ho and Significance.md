**Conducting Chi-Square Analysis by Hand**

**1)** Make a hypothesis based on your basic question
**2)** Determine the expected frequencies
**3)** Create a table with observed frequencies, expected frequencies, and chi-square values using the formula:
$$X^2 = \frac {{(O-E)^2}}{{2E}}$$
**4)** Find the degrees of freedom: (c-1)(r-1)

**5)** Find the chi-square statistic in the Chi-Square Distribution table

**6)** If chi-square statistic > your calculated chi-square value, you do not reject your null hypothesis and vice versa.
