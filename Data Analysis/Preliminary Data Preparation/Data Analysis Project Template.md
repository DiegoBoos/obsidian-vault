## 1. Define the Problem / Question / Action

Clearly state the problem you are trying to solve.

> ❗ _Avoid vague or overly broad questions._

**Checklist:**
-  Is the question clearly defined?
-  Is it aligned with business goals?
-  Is it answerable with available data?
-  Have domain experts been consulted?

**Examples:**
- ❌ Vague: _“Why are we losing customers?”_
- ✅ Better: _“What customer segments have the highest churn rate over the past 12 months?”_
## 2. Understand the Business Context
Identify the business area and its needs:

| Business Area     | Sample Questions                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Sales & Marketing | Which tactics are most effective?           |
| Operations        | Are there inefficiencies in workflows?      |
| Human Resources   | Which employees are most productive?        |
| Customer Service  | Where are the bottlenecks in response time? |
| Risk Management   | How can we detect fraud or reduce defaults? |
## 3. Choose the Type of Analysis

Decide what type of analysis best fits the question.

|Type|Focus|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Descriptive|What happened?|Summarize historical data|
|Exploratory|Why did it happen?|Find patterns and relationships|
|Predictive|What will happen?|Forecast future trends|
|Prescriptive|What should we do about it?|Recommend actions based on data|
