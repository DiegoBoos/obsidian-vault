It tells you the distance between the **largest** and **smallest** values in a dataset.\n\n### 🧮  Formula:\n\n```text\nRange = Maximum Value - Minimum Value\n```\n\n### 📌 Example:\n\nData: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]  \nRange = 25 − 5 = **20**\n\n### 📌 Pros:\n\n- Very easy to calculate\n    \n- Gives a quick sense of the spread\n### ⚠️ Cons:\n\n- Only considers **extreme values**\n    \n- **Sensitive to outliers** — doesn't reflect how values behave in the middle\n\n## 📊 Coefficient of Variation (CV) – _How consistent is the data relative to its mean?_\n\nThe **Coefficient of Variation** shows the **relative variability** of the data by comparing the **standard deviation** to the **mean**. It tells you how **\"spread out\"** the data is **relative to its average**.\n\n### 🧮 Formula:\n\n```text\nCV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100\n```\n\nExpressed as a **percentage**.\n\n### 📌 Example:\n\n- Dataset A: mean = 100, std. deviation = 5  \n    CV = (5 / 100) × 100 = **5%** → very consistent\n    \n- Dataset B: mean = 20, std. deviation = 10  \n    CV = (10 / 20) × 100 = **50%** → much more spread out\n### 📌 Use Cases:\n\n- Comparing datasets with **different scales**\n    \n- Measuring **risk vs. return** in finance\n    \n- Evaluating **stability** in experimental results\n### ⚠️ When _not_ to use CV:\n\n- When the **mean is near zero** → CV becomes unstable or meaningless\n    \n- On **interval-scaled** data where zero is arbitrary (like temperature in °C)\n### 🧠 Summary Table\n\n|Measure|Description|Best For|\n|---|---|---|\n|**Range**|Max - Min|Quick overview of spread|\n|**Coefficient of Variation**|Relative variability (% of mean)|Comparing spread across datasets with different units or scales|\n","x":660,"y":462,"width":1000,"height":686},
