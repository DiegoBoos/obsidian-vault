## ðŸ“‰ Why Reduce Dimensions?

In **high-dimensional datasets**, reducing features helps to:

- Improve **computational performance**
    
- Avoid the **curse of dimensionality**
    
- Prevent overfitting and enhance model generalizability
    
- Improve data **visualization and interpretability**
## ðŸ”¬ Common Techniques

| Technique                               | Purpose                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Missing Values Ratio**                | Eliminate columns with too many missing values.             |
| **Low Variance Filter**                 | Remove columns with little to no variation.                 |
| **High Correlation Filter**             | Remove redundant features (highly correlated with others).  |
| **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**  | Convert features into uncorrelated principal components.    |
| **Random Forest Trees + Bootstrapping** | Use importance from ensemble models to select top features. |
| **Forward/Backward Feature Selection**  | Iteratively add/remove features based on performance.       |
## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Comparison (From KNIME Study)

|Method|Dimensionality Reduction|Accuracy|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Baseline (all features)**|0%|81%|Starting point|
|**Missing Values Ratio**|71%|82%|Efficient early filter|
|**Low Variance Filter**|73%|82%|Works only for numeric data|
|**High Correlation Filter**|74%|82%|Useful for reducing redundancy|
|**PCA**|62%|72%|Lower accuracy but useful in visualization|
|**Random Forest Trees**|86%|82%|High reduction with preserved accuracy|
|**Feature Elimination/Selection**|91%|63%|Very slow on large datasets|
## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

1. **Goal**: Maximize dimensionality reduction while minimizing information loss.
    
2. **No One-Size-Fits-All**: Each method has strengths and weaknesses.
    
3. **Hybrid Approaches** are often most effective.
    
4. The **use case** determines the best strategy.
