**6)** This shows a binomial GLM model with predictors X1 and X4. Both predictors are highly significant with p-values < 0.001. The AUC is 0.86135.

**7)** This shows another binomial GLM with predictors X1, X2, and X3. The model has slightly better AUC (0.88675) with all predictors being statistically significant.

**21)** Which of the following is NOT true about Naive Bayes Classification?

Naive Bayes is a bad estimator, so the probability outputs should not carry much weight. (This is not true about Naive Bayes - while it makes simplifying assumptions, its probability estimates can still be useful)

**23)** Bayes Rule problem with the contingency table showing:

- Hospital/Cough: 100
- Hospital/No Cough: 50
- No Hospital/Cough: 40
- No Hospital/No Cough: 89
- Totals: 140 (Cough), 139 (No Cough), 150 (Hospital), 129 (No Hospital), 279 (Grand Total)

For this question: Blank 1: Prob(Hospital) = 150/279 Blank 2: Prob(Cough) = 140/279 Blank 3: Prob(Cough|Hospital) = 100/150

**28)** Based on the confusion matrices for two classification models:

1. Which model has the highest accuracy? Model 2 has higher accuracy: (34+44)/100 = 78% vs (41+41)/100 = 82%
2. Which model has the fewest Type 1 errors (false positives)? Model 1 has 7 false positives vs Model 2 has 14 false positives
3. Which model has the fewest Type 2 errors (false negatives)? Model 2 has 8 false negatives vs Model 1 has 11 false negatives
4. Which model has the highest precision? Model 1: 41/(41+7) = 0.85 vs Model 2: 44/(44+14) = 0.76 Model 1 has higher precision
