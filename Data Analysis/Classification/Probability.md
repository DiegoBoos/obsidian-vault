**Probability:** The chance that some event will occur. How likely the event is.
Mathematically, probability is measured from 0 (impossible, 0% chance) to 1 (certain, 100% chance).

The complement of an event is all the outcomes other than the event. The sum of the probabilities of an event and its complement is 1, or 100%, because the event will either happen or not happen.

P(event happening) + P(event not happening) = 1
P(event) + P(complement of event) = 1

Odds (another way to express probability)
Odds also express the likelihood (or probability) of an event.
Odds in favour: The likelihood an event will occur. (a)
Odds against: The likelihood an event will not occur. (b) 
Usually written as a colon a:b, or a to b, or a/ùëè

Event A has P(A), the ods in favour of A are P(A) to 1-P(A)
Similarly, that the odds against A are 1-P(A) to P(A)

E.g. If the probability of rain tomorrow is .25
(25%), then the odds in favour of rain are .25 to .75 (1 to 3) or ($\frac13$)

The odds against rain are .75 to .25 (3 to 1) or ($\frac31$)

The odds in favour event E are a to b or (a:b) or ($\frac{a}{b}$), 
then
$$P(E) = \frac{a}{(a+b)}$$
and,
$$P(E) = \frac{b}{(a+b)}$$
E.g. The odds for someone passing a test is 5:1 (5 to 1).


The probability is $P(E) = \frac{5}{(5+1)} = \frac56 = 0.83$
$$
3:1 for = \frac{3}{(3+1)} = 4 = .75
$$
$$
.75 = \frac{75}{(100)} = \frac{3}{(4)} = \frac{3}{(3+1)} = 3:1 for
$$
