- The fault tolerance is achieved with RDDs => resilient distributed datasets
- Basically, a set of classes that keep track of data transformations
- RDD’s also provide all the other benefits we see in Spark
	- Excellent query optimization
	- Very optimal physical plans
	- DAG – direct acyclic graph computing

**Summary**
The fault tolerance has been achieved with the use of RDD’s (resilient distributed datasets)
- RDD’s also helped Spark in other areas such as a query optimization and optimal physical plans
- Together, these improvements are the reason for Spark speed improvement
