### **1. Data Storage Management & Its Importance**

- Involves managing data securely either **on-premises** or in the **cloud**.
- Utilizes storage devices like USBs, HDDs, CDs, and cloud services.    
- **Benefits**:
    - Cost-efficiency by avoiding duplication.
    - Faster data access.
    - Security against data breaches.
### **2. Requirements for Data Storage (ATSE)**

- **Accessible**: Sync and retrieve data on demand.
- **Traceable**: Track changes and data lineage.
- **Secure**: Protect against ransomware, ensure encryption.
- **Encrypted**: Use symmetric, asymmetric encryption & hashing.
### **3. Storage Mechanisms**

- **Parallel Storage**:    
    - Used for large-scale data across many computers ("clusters" or "servers").
    - Includes **Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)**.
- **Cloud Storage**:
    - Provided by AWS, Google Cloud, Azure.
    - Supports storage **plus** ML, analytics, and deep learning capabilities.
### **4. Types of Storage**

- **Unstructured** (e.g., web, email, video): Best stored in **Document Databases** (NoSQL).
- **Structured** (tabular format): Stored in **Relational Databases** (SQL).
- **Non-Data/Object Storage**: Includes images, backups, logs, etc.
### ðŸ”Ž **5. Data Querying**

- Retrieve data using:
    - **SQL** for relational databases.
    - **NoSQL** for document databases.
- Enables filtering, summing, counting, and averaging.
### **6. Data Assembly (Think of a Library Analogy)**

- Choose **where** to store (cloud/on-premises).
- Choose **shelves** (document vs. relational DB).
- Choose **retrieval system** (SQL/NoSQL queries).
### **7. Representation of Data**

- Devices store data in digital forms:
    - **Decimal**, **Binary**, **Hexadecimal**, **Text**, **Graphics**.
### **8. Information Retrieval Systems**

- Interface for querying large repositories.
- Include:
    - **Visuals** (dashboards),
    - **Audio** (alerts),
    - **Tactile** (e.g., VR),
    - **Icons** (symbols),
    - Supports **perception and cognition** of info.
### **9. Data Retirement**

- Meet **compliance** for privacy and retention.
- Uses **policy-based archiving** and **entitlement** systems.
### **What to Remember for the Exam**

- **Know the difference** between data types and how theyâ€™re stored.
- **Understand query languages** and where they apply.
- **Storage requirements (ATSE)** are critical for real-world applications.
- Be prepared to **explain and apply** concepts like cloud storage vs. parallel storage and data assembly analogies.
- **Think about use cases** for document vs. relational databases.
