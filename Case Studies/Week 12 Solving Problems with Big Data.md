## **Key Topics Covered**

### 1. **Six Elements of a Big Data Project**

- **Data Research & Integration**: Establish data provenance and integration points; revise as necessary.    
- **Data Collection**: Regular or real-time extraction using tools like APIs, web scraping, DB queries.
- **Data Storage & Maintenance**: Long-term strategies for where and how data is stored (e.g., SQL/NoSQL).
- **Data Quality**: Accuracy, reliability, and integrity of incoming data streams.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Unlocking value through insights, trends, and patterns.
- **DevOps**: Use of GitHub and integration with existing systems to accelerate development.
### 2. **How Big Data Works**

Big data arises from diverse sources (IoT, social media, emails, etc.) and requires:
- **Integration**: Collection and ingestion into pipelines (cleaning, transforming).
- **Management**: Scalable storage (often NoSQL), enabling flexible analysis.
- **Analysis**: Tools to uncover patterns and support decision-making.
### 3. **KPIs for Big Data**

#### Level 1 – **4Vs**
- **Volume**: Data size (e.g., GB, TB)
- **Variety**: Number of different data types/sources
- **Velocity**: Speed of data generation/analysis
- **Veracity**: Accuracy level of the data (context-dependent)
#### Level 2 – **Process Metrics**
- Metrics: Time to collect, analyze, and report
- Contextual benchmarks (e.g., real-time vs. weekly)
#### Level 3 – **Lagging Indicators**
- Business impact: Cost savings, customer retention, HR efficiency
- Evidence of how insights improved performance or outcomes
### 4. **Emerging Trends in Big Data**

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Enhancing analytics, NLP, recommendations
- **Virtual Reality (VR)**: Training, education, business applications
- **Internet of Things (IoT)**: Network of connected devices enabling data-driven operations
### 5. **Internet of Things (IoT)**

#### Types of IoT Applications
1. **Consumer IoT**: Wearables, smart homes
2. **Industrial IoT (IIoT)**: Smart factories, energy systems
3. **Commercial IoT**: Retail, healthcare systems
#### How IoT Works
- Platforms manage connectivity and applications
- Sensors convert real-world variables to data
- Unique identifiers like IP addresses track device identity
- AI and ML power smart interactions
- **Edge computing** reduces latency by processing near the source
#### Benefits

- Automation, efficiency, real-time alerts, cost reduction
- Enhanced analytics and decision-making
#### Drawbacks

- **Security**: Varies by manufacturer    
- **Privacy**: Data exposure risks
- **Bandwidth**: Network strain from multiple devices
#### Applications

- **Healthcare**: Monitoring vitals, early warnings    
- **SMBs**: Real-time analytics, smart systems for safety and control
